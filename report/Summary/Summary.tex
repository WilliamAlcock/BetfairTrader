\chapter{Summary}
	The gambling industry has been around for centuries but in recent years the nature of traditional betting markets have been revolutionised by the advent of electronic betting exchanges. Betfair is one of the leading betting exchanges. This project has two sections.\\

The first section aims to build a distributed trading system for the Betfair Exchange.\\

The second section aims to build a model to predict the direction of prices on the Betfair Exchange's horse racing markets by studying past market data using quantitative technical analysis and machine learning.\\

The dissertation covers the following areas:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item An introduction to the gambling industry and betting exchanges.
		\item Professional ethical considerations surrounding this project.
		\item Requirements analysis for both sections of the project.
		\item The design and implementation of a trading system for the Betfair Exchange.
		\item The implementation and testing of a model trained using pre-labelled historical market data to predict Betfair market trends.
	\end{itemize}

Appendix~\ref{appendix:glossaryOfTerms} includes a glossary of gambling and machine learning terms used in this dissertation. Those unfamiliar with these subjects are advised to read this section first.
