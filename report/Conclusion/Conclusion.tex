	\section{Suggestions for future extensions}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item First section:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Change the auto trader so it can be programmed by the user as proposed in the interim report.
				\item Add accounting functions to the core server. The Core Server keeps track of orders and matched position by market but it doesn't keep track of a user's PnL across all markets at once.
				\item Add more functionality to the Simulated Order Book
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Improve the way orders are matched
					\item Cancel orders when markets turn to suspended, this is what happens on the Live Service for Football
					\item Add the ability to handle all projections and order types.
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}

			\item Second section:
				\item Investigate the use of a wider range of machine learning modules on the historical data and compare the results with the Random Forest
				\item Integrate the system with Spark so the system can utilise it's MLlib.
				\item Test the models using a larger amount of historical data. This could include more up-to-date data captured for the Betfair exchange.
		\end{itemize}
