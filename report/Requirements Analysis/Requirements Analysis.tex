\chapter{Requirements Analysis}

The requirements were formed firstly by looking at the Betfair website and existing commercially available trading systems for electronic betting exchanges. Secondly by looking at the Betfair NG API and thirdly by looking at a basic betting strategy and formulating some requirements for a language to describe that strategy. This section will discuss pros and cons of existing solutions, what an ideal solution would entail and what parts of that solution can feasibly be implemented in the given time frame and should therefore be included in the project.\\

\section{The Users}

The users of the system will be traders. Their primary objective will be to effectively trade a chosen market thereby maximising profits and minimising loses.\\

\textbf{Manually trading}\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ability to navigate markets
		\item Receive fast and regular updates on market activity. 
		\item Ability to quickly place and alter orders in a given market 
		\item Quick and accurate notifications when orders are matched.
	\end{itemize}

\textbf{Automated trading}\\

	\begin{itemize}
		\item A simple and consistent way to describe a strategy that the system can understand and process. 
		\item Ability to test a strategies behaviour without placing orders in a live market. 
		\item Ability to review what orders the system has placed and when and why it placed those orders. 
		\item Ability to review and replay the systems behaviour after the fact.
	\end{itemize}

The software will need to be well tested and bug free as any unexpected behaviour could result in substantial financial loses.

	\todo[inline]{This section will be rewritten before the final draft. I would like to completely rewrite the requirements analysis from the interim report and I am unsure how to proceed.\\
	
	How closely should I stick to the interim report ?\\ 
	The GUI comparison of existing systems in the interim report seems unnecessary.\\ 
	I want to remove the section about creating a programming language for the user to define a trading strategy as this hasn't been included in the implementation.\\
	What format is required ? I would like to keep it brief outlining some functional and non functional requirements in bullet point form.\\
