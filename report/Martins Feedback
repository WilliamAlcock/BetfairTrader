4.1 Motivation
	This section is supposed to give a very brief overview of the project. Instead it gives an overview of the gambling industry
	This should contain an overview over what the project does ...

4.2 Background
	This is very important
	Need to explain a bit more about betting, imagine the reader knows nothing about betting
	The swansea vs arsenal example is already very hard to understand
	Use terms such as to Back and to Lay without any real explination. this could be explained better
		- To Back 
		- To Lay
		- Offering lower odds what does this mean
		- Those that are predicted ? Who predicts them, how are they predicted ?

	Figure 4.1 is very nice but:
		- Dont explain what all the pound figures are (Volume)
		- 4.8 representing 3.8/1 i.e. 4.8 * stake returned - this does not makes sense
			- explain decimal odds vs fractional odds

		- Explain more about the thing that revolutionised the practice of betting
			- Can punters propose markets ? or can they just bet in either direction

Have a section at the front that explains terminology. THIS IS A VERY GOOD IDEA
	
	4.2.2
		The price of betting contracts will speculate over time
			- this should be explained in more detail

		Table 4.1 does this a bit but needs more explination
			- It is confusing what win/lose this relates to

		The last sentence in this section needs explaining in more detail:
			"This free back bet can then be used to ensure the user wins a lesser amount on all eventualities of the event by backing the other outcomes (Arsenal to Win / The Draw) for a smaller amount."

	4.2.3
		Talk about price sensitivity this needs explaining in more detail

		"In contrast to the gambler the trader will probably not keep the bet on by the time the event has been realised having already closed the trade" - not sure what this means

4.3 Project Objectives
		
	This is the first time the Betfair exchange is mentioned. Maybe in previous sections explain what betfair is and what they do and why I have chosen to use the Betfair API

	Also talk about building a model that can be used as an indicator. Explain what the purpose of building a model for a market is earlier on. This will fit well in the introduction

	Instead of saying "This project will be split into two sections" Say "This project has two parts: Building a trading system, building machine learning strategies and models."

	In the objectives I use a lot of terminology that is not explain:
		- What is a metric
		- WHy do you broadcast the state of orders
		- Why do you amend orders
		- What is it to place orders

		- What is histrical data
		- What does it mean to test and model
		- What does it mean to train a model
		- What is machine learning
		- Why do we need machine learning
		- Explain the consept of machine learning, give a brief overview early on

6 Requirements Analysis

	The first paragraph can be improved
		- What is it a want to do from a traders view
		- Doesnt say very much about the requirements as regards the machine learning parts
		- What does it mean to implement a language to discribe strategies

7 Development Approach

	7.1 Programming Languages
		- Java Bite Code is spelt wrong
		- Explain more about the development approach explain agile vs waterfall. Explain this and explain reasoning

	7.2 Unit Test
		- "Due to the exploratory nature of the development proces..." what you are refering to is TDD
			- What should be said is we are not using TDD because ... (TDD is the technical term)

		- Say a bit about where the test orical comes from 
			- How do you know what the outcome should be
			- How do you know how the strategy outputs the correct trades
			- Talk about integration test as you only mention unit test

	7.3 
		- The writing can be tightened up Remove "As such"
		- Remove the word "Very" it never adds anything
		- Remove I from this paragraph, dont mix I and the author

8 Design and Implementation
	Talk about distributed client server architecture, very briefly
		- What were the alternatives ? why have you not chosen them
	Talk about the reasons for selecting them
		- Why are these a good thing
			For example:
				- The server will have central control of data and resources.
					- Why is this good ?
					- What happens if the server goes down ? The server is clearly a single point of failure
					- You could answer that the project is not about the resiliancy of trading apps and that is an orthogonal problem.
					- Currently only interested in the functionality
					- Not interested in security or resiliance
				- The client and server can be developed in isolation.
					- Why is that a good thing
					- How does client server enforce modularity
						- Because they are connected through a wire protocol which should be as small as possible
	8.1 Server
		Figure 8.1
			- Where does a trading strategy sit
			- The Core server will communicate with this and that, is it just a communication layer, probably not, need to clarify this

		The last sentence before 8.1.1 is a bit confusing remove (THIS NEEDS TO BE REMOVED)

	8.1.1
		Confusing
			- Start by talking about betfair providing sample code
			- At this point I should describe the services and functionality the service layer provide to the layer above and what it assumes from the layer below
			- Seperate the description of the services the layer provides and assumes from the implementation, the Scala and Spray stuff
			- Start with the functionality when this is locked say at the end what technologies you are using

Start By describing the core sever functionality, then explain the layered approach

	8.1.2
		Live service layer, Simulated service layer
			- Start by describing 

	8.1.3
		Suddenly start talking about the event bus and an event based architecture
			- It would be usefull for the reader to decsribe this in detail !
			- This is a core design detail that needs explaining in detail. 
				- Why have you chosen it ?
				- What does it mean, what is an event bus ?
				- What does it mean to subscribe to a channel ?
				- What is a channel ?

	8.1.6 
		Data provider
			- what is the data provider
			- is this something you have implemented or is betfair the data provider
			- you jump from a very abstract to a very detailed description and it is a jump for level of detail and it is not highly readable

	8.1.7
		Data Model
			- "Each time it receives a new update for a given market it checks if it is different from the copy it already has". Use it here for two different things
			- What does it mean to compare an update for something it already has

	8.1.11
		Autotrader
			Dont refer to the interim report.
				- This is not necessary
				- It is fine I have changed the objectives, dont bother the reader with it
				- Why are Akka FSM are the perfect abstraction for defining a strategy

	8.2

		I say "As stated earlier in this report", in fact I do this a lot and its not necessary REMOVE IT


	8.2.1 
		I say "The client will be designed to run in the browser"
			- I havent said why it is good to have the UI in the browser
				- why not write a dedicated Scala UI
				- Browser based UI is cross platform

	9.4
		Lots of technical terminology that is not explained
			- Maximising Entropy gain
			- Overfitting
			- Low bias
			- High variance
			- Pruning a decision tree

	9.5
		When siting books/papers no need to write names etc in text, just add [14]
		If you want to name the title /authors put them in italics
		I have given an example of a decision tree but none of a random forest or extremely random forest
		It would be good for the reader to give examples of all of them


Martins Conclusion

Can be improved still
Get somebody else to read it from scratch
Find places where the grammer is not right
Use text to speach facility on computer to check it
