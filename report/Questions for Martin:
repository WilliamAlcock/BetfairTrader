Questions for Martin:

Development:

- Datastore						*
- More detailed autotrader		
- Integrate Decision Tree		*

Report:

Change the name of the project, drop Automated ?

What level of documentation is expected for my code ?
	- This could be very time consuming

Can I submit my code as a github link ?
	- What if I want to continue working on it ? 
	- can I branch the project and submit the branch ?

What format should I use for diagrams ? 
	- do they all need to conform to a specific format ?

What format should I use for references ?

DEMO:

show gui:
	- navigation
	- manual trading
	- autotrader
show classifier:
	- run classifier

Notes to self:

- Acknowledge all libraries used

- 12,000 Words

- Expectation appendices will not total more than 20 pages

Sections:

- Cover sheet									DONE

- Body of Report
	- Requirements analysis and specification of the problem you have tackled.
	- Description of how you designed, built and evaluated yuor system.
		- Usually occupy several chapters
		- Will often include sections on:
			- Implementation and testing (what kinds of testing ?)
			- A discussion of the principles which underlie the program that has been written
				- The significance of its data structures
				- The way that its procedures and modules interact etc. A line by line description of your code is not the best way of achieving this and is NOT encouraged
				- Evalutae your finished product using appropriate methods, backing you claims with evidence
				- Evalutaing results should be related back to the original requirements
				- A summary of the evaluation should appear in the Conclusion section
- Conclusion
	- This should include an assessment of the success of the finished product
	- Have you achieved your objectives ?
	- If not, why not ?
	- It should contain suggestions for future extensions, or alternative methodologies, with hindsight, might have led to a better system
- References
	- Must be given correctly
	- Full references with page numbers are required
	- If you consult a similar project done in previous years you must reference it
	- The references should be cited in the body of your report where appropriate
	- Webpages you consulted need to be listed as well
		- Title/topic of the Webpage and the last time you accessed it, not just the URL
- Appendices
	- Project logs
	- Additional relevant system or test data
	- Any technical material which you estimate is too detailed for the main body of the report
	- You should make sure any technical material is appropriately annotated and consistenly presented
	- DO NOT INCLUDE SOURCE CODE
	- Any material that does not fit in the report's Appendix that you deem important can be included in the electronic submission (Although it may not be viewed)
