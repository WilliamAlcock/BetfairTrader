\chapter{Introduction}
	This project has two parts. 
	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Build a computer trading system for the Betfair Exchange that can be used to automate trading.
			\item Use technical analysis and machine learning to train a model that can predict market trends.\\
		\end{enumerate}			

	The gambling industry has been around for centuries but in recent years the nature of traditional betting markets has been revolutionised with the advent of electronic betting exchanges. Betting exchange markets share some similarities with financial markets and the automated trading of financial markets is wide spread and a topical subject. The motivation behind this project was to see if some of the principles applied to financial trading can be applied to trade betting exchanges.\\
	
	This section provides 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An introduction to the Betfair Exchange and how it can be traded.
			\item An explanation of the advantages of an automated trading system.
			\item A brief overview of technical analysis and machine learning.
			\item A list of the primary and secondary objectives for each part of the project.
