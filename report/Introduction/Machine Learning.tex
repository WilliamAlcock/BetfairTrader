\section{Machine Learning}
	Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed\cite{machineLearning}. Machine learning focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from patterns in data to build a model that can make predictions. These algorithms aim to build a model that encodes a mapping from a set of features in the data to an output and can be split into two categories: 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Supervised learning - The algorithm is given examples of the data that have already been labelled with an output. This training data is used to build a model that encodes a mapping from the data to the output. Supervised learning algorithms can be divided into two types
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Classification - which maps the data into a distinct group.
				\item Regression - which maps the data into a real value.			
			\end{itemize}
		\item Unsupervised learning - The algorithm is given examples that are not labelled and uses them to find structure in the data e.g; Clustering, which groups the data based on its features.
	\end{itemize}
