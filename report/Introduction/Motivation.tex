\section{Motivation}
		The gambling industry has been around for centuries but in recent years the nature of traditional betting markets has been revolutionised by the advent of electronic betting exchanges.\\
		
		A betting exchange allows gamblers to bet against each other rather than against a bookmaker. Users can place orders on a given market to back or lay at any chosen price and as a result the contracts hosted on electronic betting exchanges share many similarities with financial markets. Betfair is one of the leading betting exchanges processing over 1.2 billion bets a year, with a trading value of \pounds 56 billion\cite{ABettingRevolution}\\
		
		Automated trading on financial markets is wide spread and has been very well documented\cite{TheFutureofComputerTradinginFinancialMarkets}. Now with the emergence of electronic betting exchanges it is possible to automate trading on the sporting and cultural events hosted by these exchanges applying similar strategies as those used on financial markets.\\
		
		Betfair currently exposes the NG API (Application Programmers interface) to users allowing them to programatically interact with the exchange. Using the API a user can request data on available markets and place orders into a chosen market.
